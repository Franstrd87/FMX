                        Fuck my ex indeed. I've done everything for her, saved her life, changed her life, everything in the name of love and she did me even worse than cheating but without cheating. If karma really exsists, it will make her pay, otherwise I have no belief in karma. I hope lego shower gets her. - FMX Anonymous

                        Fucking my ex is exactly what I'm not doing and neither is fucking your ex. But seriously, shitty breakups are awful. I started dating a girl in november, was going well, bought her a christmas gift, etc. She comes over as usual, cuddling, joking around. Then she starts trying to make up reasons to ditch me, first saying she might be out of province in a different job, then she wanted to travel, then finally the classic 'not me it's you' thing. Cries to get the point across, kept my pokerface and when she leaves says she wants to stay in touch as friends. Two texts over a period of a week and a half and poof she's gone. Presumably wanted some holiday season validation and got bored. Thrill of the chase sucks but dodged a bullet. Renewed my lease, landing a crazy good paying job and never better. Just look at it from a perspective of them being full of crap and imagining karma that doesn't involve death. Hey, you're fine! - FMX Anonymous

                        My girlfriend told me the week before I went to college that I got her pregnant knowing that we were not going to date long distance. She sent me a picture of a stock photo pregnancy test she cropped that was positive I literally just Google searched ‘Positive Pregnancy Tests’ and it was one of the first ones. I made her come over and take another one. It was negative, she left. - FMX Anonymous
